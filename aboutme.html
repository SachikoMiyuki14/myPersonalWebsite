	 	<h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Sissy, born and raised in the vibrant city of Quezon City, particularly in the charming district of Fairview. My family, my partner, and my close friends are my constant sources of strength and encouragement as I make my way through the exciting journey which is college life. These relationships provide me joy and inspiration. <br> <br> Currently, I'm in my 2nd year of college at National University Fairview, diving into the world of information technology. Education is a key player in my personal and intellectual journey, equipping me with the skills to navigate the complexities of the world. <br> <br> When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me catching waves on a surfboard; there's something magical about the sea. And, I absolutely love exploring new places. Every trip is like a mini-adventure, teaching me new things and helping me see the world from different angles. </p>
